# Dotnet Remote Fetch

For some time I wanted to write a very simple web scraper that would well... scrape some things from time to time and save them in a database.
I also wanted to learn a bit about dotnet core and how to neatly organize something larger than a PowerShell script.

## Getting Started

> ### Warning!

> This is a learning project written by a guy who wants to dabble in dotnet core. Many things are probably wrong here, some are even horribly horribly wrong.
> Over time they will get better though.

### How to run it

Before you run the application make sure to edit changes in the appsettings.json file and have a MySQL connection string ready.

Running the application is just a matter of cloning it and fiddling with either [dotnet run](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run) or [dotnet build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) commands.
